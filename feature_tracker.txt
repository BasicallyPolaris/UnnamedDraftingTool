CURRENT WORK:

THEN:

IDEAS:

- Data presets (maybe some templates like "assasin midlaner", "tank toplaner" etc? This could work in the form of premade JSON snippets)

- Comfort level indicator for champions (border coloring repurposed?)

- Add a pickbanggwebapp-like minimap with picked champions (on another screen like menu/manual?)

- Testing

- GUI for making champion pools

- figure out github manual styling

- fix form styling

- consider data input placement (to the side?)

- be explicit about shift P etc for big letters ( allow CAPSLOCK to work ) 

- add the set searching to search query

- a welcome screen to explain biggest features

- add themes with different color palletes

- Dragging a champion onto itself shouldnt cause it to be unpicked

- Self-inputtable team statistics (gather pick stats for enemy team >> input it >> it shows in some way)

BUGS:
