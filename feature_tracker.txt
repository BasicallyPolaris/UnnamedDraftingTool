CURRENT WORK:
    
THEN:

- There should be a button to load the currently saved user data

- Data presets (maybe some templates like "assasin midlaner", "tank toplaner" etc? This could work in the form of premade JSON snippets)
IDEAS:
- Keyboard shortcuts

- Revamp team icons

- Dragging champions around from picks

BUGS:
