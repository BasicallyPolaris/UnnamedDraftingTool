CURRENT WORK:
- Drag and drop support
THEN:
- Color champion borders green/red/mixed based on the team they belong to 

IDEAS:
- Keyboard shortcuts

- Data presets (maybe some templates like "assasin midlaner", "tank toplaner" etc? This could work in the form of premade JSON snippets)

- Revamp team icons
