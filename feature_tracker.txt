CURRENT WORK:

THEN:

IDEAS:

- Data presets (maybe some templates like "assasin midlaner", "tank toplaner" etc? This could work in the form of premade JSON snippets)

- Comfort level indicator for champions (border coloring repurposed?)

- Add a pickbanggwebapp-like minimap with picked champions (on another screen like menu/manual?)

- Testing

- GUI for making champion pools

- figure out github manual styling

- fix form styling

- consider data input placement (to the side?)

- add the set searching to search query

- a welcome screen to explain biggest features

- add themes with different color palletes

- Dragging a champion onto itself shouldnt cause it to be unpicked

- Self-inputtable team statistics (gather pick stats for enemy team >> input it >> it shows in some way)

- allow toggling centered vs tiles for picks

- display mode information to user

- add a bind to unpick champion

BUGS:

- Not a bug but good to remember and think about:
When you leave the mouse in the middle of the champions, then search, unless you have only 1 champ remaining, when you press a button 0-9 it will pick your last hovered champion (quite random if you were just searching), this is due to hover being stringer than non-explicit search and can be confusing
