CURRENT WORK:

THEN:

IDEAS:

- Data presets (maybe some templates like "assasin midlaner", "tank toplaner" etc? This could work in the form of premade JSON snippets)

- Comfort level indicator for champions (border coloring repurposed?)

- Give feedback on correct/incorrect data (background color in the input element?)

- Add a pickbanggwebapp-like minimap with picked champions (on another screen like menu/manual?)

- Testing

BUGS:
